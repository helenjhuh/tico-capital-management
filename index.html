              person in any jurisdiction where the offering of any Fund is

            <h2>Investment risks</h2>
            <p>
              There are significant risks associated with investment in the Funds
              outlined in the website. Investment is intended for sophisticated
              investors who can accept the risks associated with such an investment
              including a substantial or complete loss of their investment and who
              have no need for immediate liquidity in their investment. Investments
              will be subject to strict limitations on transferability and
              withdrawal. There will be no secondary or public market. The value of
              investments and any income derived from them can go down as well as up
              and the value of an investor's investment may be subject to sudden and
              substantial falls. The loss on realisation may be very high and could
              result in a substantial or complete loss of investment. Past
              performance is not an indicator of a future positive performance. Most
              if not all of the protections provided by the UK
              regulatory structure will not apply to the Funds. Some investment
              positions may be illiquid and investment may be made in non-publicly
              traded securities. The foregoing list of risk factors is not complete
              and reference should be made to the relevant Fund’s offering document.
              An investment may only be made after receiving and reviewing the
              offering document and the risk factors contained therein. You should
              rely only on the offering document in making any decision to invest.
              If you are considering investing in a Fund, you should first consult
              with your professional advisors.
